Electric Vehicle Sales by State in India - Data Analytics Report
Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize electric vehicle (EV) sales trends across different states in India, offering insights into market adoption, sales distribution, and future growth potential. The dataset provides granular details, including vehicle classification, sales quantity, and geographic segmentation.
Dataset Overview
The dataset includes state-level EV sales data with the following key features:
- Year – The year of recorded EV sales.
- Month – The month in which sales occurred.
- State – The Indian state where EVs were sold.
- Vehicle Type – Classification such as Two-Wheelers, Three-Wheelers, Four-Wheelers, Buses, and Institutional Vehicles.
- Vehicle Category – Further segmentation into commercial and passenger vehicles.
- EV Sales Quantity – Number of EVs sold per state, essential for adoption trend analysis.

The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed, ensuring accuracy and readiness for exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and predictive modeling.
Data Analytics Process
To conduct a thorough analysis, a combination of Python (Jupyter Notebook) for data exploration, DAX for advanced calculations, and Power BI for visualization was utilized.
1. Data Exploration using Python (Jupyter Notebook)
Step 1: Data Loading and Inspection
- Imported the dataset using Pandas.
- Verified data structure, column types, and checked for missing values.

Step 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Converted date columns to datetime format.
- Handled missing values using median for numerical features and mode for categorical features.
- Encoded categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding.

Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized yearly EV sales trends, state-wise distributions, and vehicle categories.
- Used POWER BI for insightful visualizations.

2. Advanced Analytics using DAX in Power BI
Power BI was leveraged to build interactive dashboards and uncover deep insights using DAX calculations.
Key Metrics Created using DAX:
- Total EV Sales:
- Year-over-Year Growth:
- State-wise Contribution to Total Sales:

Power BI Dashboards Created:
- Yearly and Monthly EV Sales Trends (Line Charts)
- State-wise EV Sales Distribution (Map Visualization)
- Vehicle Category Contribution (Stacked Bar Chart)
- Growth Prediction Model Integration (Forecasting)

REPORT
Electric Vehicle Sales Analysis Report - India
Objective
The goal of this analysis is to examine EV sales trends in India across different time frames, geographic distributions, vehicle types, and classifications.
Key Findings
1. Yearly Sales Trends
EV sales in India have seen consistent growth, particularly in recent years. The data indicates a sharp rise, with 2024 showing the highest recorded sales, underscoring the increasing adoption of electric mobility.

2. Monthly Sales Analysis
EV sales exhibit seasonal variations, with notable spikes in specific months. December and March tend to witness higher sales, likely influenced by year-end purchases, financial closures, and government incentives

3. State-wise EV Sales Distribution
The highest number of EV sales is concentrated in:
- Delhi
- Uttar Pradesh
- Karnataka
- Maharashtra
- Rajasthan
- Tamil Nadu

This suggests urban centers and regions with strong industrial and commercial activity are leading in EV adoption. Less populated states like Tripura, Goa, and Mizoram report significantly lower sales figures

4. Analysis by Vehicle Class
The E-Rickshaw (Passenger) category dominates EV sales, followed closely by Motorcycles/Scooters and Electric Cars. This highlights that two-wheelers and three-wheelers remain key contributors to India's EV revolution, catering to both personal and commercial usage.

5. Vehicle Type Breakdown
- Two-wheelers (2W) are the leading category, indicating a widespread consumer shift towards electric bikes and scooters.
- Three-wheelers (3W - Passenger and Goods) account for a substantial share, widely used in urban transport systems.
- Four-wheelers (4W - Personal & Shared) show growing adoption, particularly in metropolitan areas.
- Buses and institutional vehicles have a relatively lower presence but are likely to increase as government policies favor electric public transport.

6. EV Market Expansion
The increasing trend in EV adoption is driven by:
- Government incentives and policy support
- Infrastructure development for charging stations
- Rising fuel prices leading to demand for cost-effective alternatives
- Growing environmental awareness and emission concerns

Conclusion
India's EV market is experiencing rapid growth, with strong adoption across two-wheelers, three-wheelers, and passenger vehicles. The trends indicate sustained expansion, especially in metropolitan and industrial regions. The future outlook suggests continued EV integration into both commercial and personal transport sectors.
